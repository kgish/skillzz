# Skillz-alot

Advanced website platform for matching skilled workers to customers searching for the best and most appropriate person for a given task.

## Coding Challenge

Given a website which matches workers to customers. 

A worker is a registered user, who possesses one or more skills like “cooking”, “house cleaning”, “fixing wireless networks”, and so on. 

A customer, also a registered user, can search for workers by skill.
For example, if a customer needs a worker who can do both cooking and house-cleaning, she will go to the site, choose both these skills from a list, and get a list of workers from which to choose.

The site could have perhaps up to 1,000 workers, 10,000 customers and 100 skills.

The challenge: create a prototype of this website, with the main focus on the back end, especially the models and search functionality.
